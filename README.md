# DevOps Kathmandu Meetups(past/present/future)

This repo is for information, useful links(video, slides, docs) from our Community Meetups.

## Overview
DevOps Kathmandu is a common platform started in 2018 bringing development, operations, QA, management & leadership together to discuss the culture and tools to make better organizations & products. We organize meetup, gatherings, sessions on DevOps-y topics with the view to enhance collaboration & communication of like minded people in Kathmandu as well as connect with global communities.

Its open ground for all - from starting minds to veteran who are interested in sharing and hearing stories, giving talks, open discussions and explore more.
